work in progress. Lost hours to diagnosing an empty screen; turns out, I didn't swap the API token out for my own. Now I've spent even more hours trying to figure out why the scaled dots aren't showing up even on my copy of the example; still no answer to that, so no idea if my stuff actually works.

for the purpose of grading, the only work I did so far was on main.js. Overwriting the main.js of the example with mine, + adding the contents of the assets directory should render it as functional as it's gonna be in its current state.

this lab was a difficulty spike relative to the last few. i did not account for this when managing my time.

lo siento. better luck next time, I suppose. I'd like a chance to redo this, but I figure I'm past the deadline to request such a thing.
